# NailCreator

This project allows a nail stylist to describe desired nail designs using colors, themes, and feelings. It then sends that description to the Sora Open API to receive up to four design ideas.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (requires the `requests` library):
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python nail_creator.py
   ```
3. Provide the description and optional feelings when prompted, and the script will print out design ideas generated by the API.

Note: Replace `API_URL` in `nail_creator.py` with the actual endpoint for Sora's API.
